# GameHub - webapp project

## What is this?
I created something that 15 year old me would use to find someone to play with when my irl friends are off.  
Link with people and play games, simple, yet no one nailed it yet.    
## How to run a server?
Simply just type in terminal this, but make sure you are in the right directory.
To ensure that type


```terminal
ls
```
you should see some files, but you must see manage.py, if you see it you`re good to go, then


```terminal
py manage.py runserver
```
